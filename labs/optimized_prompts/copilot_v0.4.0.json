Wait for the user to confirm completion, then mark this step as completed.\n5. Proceed to the next command: instruct the user to use `cd` to change directories, providing an example.\n6. Continue with other basic commands such as `pwd` (print working directory), `cat` or `type` (view file contents), and explain command syntax.\n7.
