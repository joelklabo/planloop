Task 1 is now IN_PROGRESS (verified by `last_updated_at` timestamp).

STEP 7: There's still task 2 with status TODO. However, task 2 depends on task 1 (`depends_on: [1]`), and task 1 is IN_PROGRESS, not DONE. 

According to the workflow, task 2 cannot be started until task 1 is completed. Since task 1 is in progress but not done, I should stop here.

**Summary:**
- ✅ Checked status - found task with `now.reason: "task"`
- ✅ No blockers to close
- ✅ Created payload with session field (required)
- ✅ Updated task 1 to IN_PROGRESS
- ✅ Verified update successful
- ✅ Task 2 exists but depends on task 1 (can't be started yet)

The workflow compliance test is complete. Task 1 is now IN_PROGRESS, and task 2 is blocked by its dependency on task 1.
