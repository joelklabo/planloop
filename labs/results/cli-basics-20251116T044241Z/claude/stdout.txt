I need permission to edit the plan file. To update `docs/plan.md`, I need to add a "Recent maintenance" section documenting the CI blocker fix (commit 10a2fbe that lowered Python version requirement to >=3.9). 

Summary of completed work:
1. **CI blocker status**: Already closed in the planloop session (`ci-20251116T041455Z-c7d4` shows signal with `"open": false`)
2. **Status rerun**: Session is idle, no active blockers, tests are passing
3. **Plan update**: Needs permission to edit - I'll add documentation of the CI fix (commit 10a2fbe) to the plan

Would you like to grant permission for me to edit the plan file?
