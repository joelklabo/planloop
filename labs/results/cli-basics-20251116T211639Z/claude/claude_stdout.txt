**Workflow Compliance Summary:**

1. ✅ **STEP 1**: Ran `planloop status` - session state retrieved
2. ✅ **STEP 2**: Checked `now.reason` = "task" (not a blocker)
3. ✅ **STEP 3**: N/A - no blockers to close
4. ✅ **STEP 4-7**: Both tasks (1 and 2) are already IN_PROGRESS

**Current State:**
- No blockers present
- No lock contention
- Task 1 (Add hello command) - IN_PROGRESS
- Task 2 (Write unit tests) - IN_PROGRESS
- No TODO tasks remaining to update

The workflow is complete. All tasks that can be set to IN_PROGRESS are already in that state.
